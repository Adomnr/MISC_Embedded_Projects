RF Tuner down converts analog RF signals to analog IF Frequencies.
A/D Converter digitzes the IF signal creating real digital samples.
Digital Mixer and Local Oscillator translate digital IF to complex baseband
Digital FIR Low Pass filter limits the complex baseband signal bandwidth.
DDC = Complex Mixer + Local Oscillator + Decimating Low Pass Filter.
Digital Signal Processing stage performs signal demodulation, etc.


DDC: Two-Step Signal Processing

Frequency Translation
	Tuning (down conversion frequency) is controlled by Local Oscillator Setting
Low Pass Filtering
	Decimation Setting controls filter bandwidth AND decimation
	As the filter bandwidth becomes lower, the decimation factor increases.

Digital Upconverters - DUCs
	Transmitter System
	Interpolation

Software Radio Transmitter

DSP stage generates complex baseband digital signal
Digital up Converter translates complex baseband digital signal.
D/A converter converts real digital IF samples to analog IF signal.
RF Upconverter translates analog IF signals to analog RF Frequencies
Power amplifier boosts signal energy to antenna.



Digital UpConverter

D/A output rate must be high enough to satisfy Nyquist for IF output.
Digital Mixer translates baseband samples up to IF frequency.
Mixer must deliver output samples at the D/A sample rate.
Mixer generates one output samples for each of two input samples.
Local Oscillator & baseband sample rate must be at D/A sample raate
Digital baseband input sample rate is much lower
Interpolation filter solves the problem.

Complex Interpolating Filter
Interpolation filter increases the sampling rate of the complex baseband input signal.
Interpolation Factor N determines the ratio.
Interpolation does NOT change the baseband frequenct - just increases the sample rate.
